# Work on MNIST Dataset
Comparison between L1 and L2 regularization

## Goals
1. Run 4 different models for 40 epochs with following criteria for each model:
   * Without L1 and L2
   * With L1
   * With L2
   * With L1 and L2
   
2. Find any 25 misclassified images for all models

3. Plot validation accuracy and loss change graphs for all models with proper legends
