# Work on MNIST Dataset

## Goals
* Validation accuracy >= 99.4% (consistent for last few epochs)
* Parameters < 10,000
* Epochs <= 15
* No fully connected layer

## Overview
The folder S5 contains 5 files which represents 5 models to show step by step approach to achieve the goals which are set above. Each of the file explains the target, results and analysis of each model.

## Result
The 5th model achieves a consistent validation accuracy of more than 99.4% in the last 6 epochs with 9,142 parameters.
